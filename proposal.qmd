## Introduction

Our project leverages a comprehensive COVID-19 dataset from Kaggle to unlock insights into the pandemic's dynamics through advanced data visualization, utilizing the `Shiny app package` for interactive user experiences. By analyzing case counts, recovery rates, mortality, and vaccination data, we aim to reveal trends and correlations across different regions and periods. This endeavor transcends academic boundaries, aiming to provide actionable insights for policymakers and the public. Through our analysis, which includes dynamic and interactive visualizations made possible by Shiny, we aspire to transform complex data into clear, insightful narratives, aiding in the informed response to this global health crisis.

## Description

-   The datasets employed for this project are derived from an extensive collection on Kaggle, curated by "imdevskp," which meticulously compiles data pertaining to the COVID-19 pandemic from multiple global sources. This collection encompasses a variety of datasets, each tailored to different analytical needs: day-wise global statistics offer a temporal view of the pandemic's progression, country-wise latest data provide a snapshot of the current status in each country, and detailed data grouped by country and date facilitate a comparative analysis over time.

-   Additionally, there is a dataset specifically focused on the USA, breaking down statistics to the county level, which allows for a more granular examination within the United States. These datasets collectively encompass critical metrics such as case counts, deaths, recoveries, and vaccination figures, equipping researchers with a robust toolkit for a comprehensive and nuanced analysis of the pandemic's multifarious impacts and trends.

-   To enhance the interactive exploration and visualization of this data, we are utilizing the **shiny package** in R, a powerful tool for creating interactive web applications. The Shiny app will allow users to **dynamically filter**, explore, and visualize the data, offering an immersive and user-driven analysis experience that highlights the depth and complexity of the COVID-19 pandemic data.

-   The choice of these datasets was motivated by their depth, regular updates, and the potential insights they offer into the global and localized impacts of COVID-19.

## Questions

### Question 1

How has the COVID-19 pandemic trended globally over time, and what correlations can be observed between different pandemic metrics (like cases and recoveries)?

### Question 2

What is the relationship between total vaccinations and the reduction in active COVID-19 cases across different Counties in USA?

## Analysis plan

### For the first question:

Dataset: We will utilize the `day_wise_data` dataset, which provides daily global statistics on COVID-19.

**Focus**: Our refined analysis will focus on daily total cases, recoveries, and deaths to observe the pandemic's evolution over time without losing granularity in the data.

**Visualizations:**

-   **Time-Series Plots**: We'll employ time-series plots to illustrate the daily evolution of total cases, recoveries, and deaths, with separate line graphs for each metric and a combined graph for direct comparison.

-   **Daily Percentage Changes**: To capture the pandemic's dynamics, we'll calculate and plot daily percentage changes for each metric. Additionally, we'll compute and visualize correlation coefficients to explore the relationships between these metrics over time.

**Additional Analysis:**

-   Rolling Average Analysis: While our primary focus will be on daily data, we'll also use rolling averages to identify broader trends, ensuring we capture both immediate changes and more extended patterns.

-   Anomaly Detection: We plan to identify and analyze any unusual data points or trends, which could indicate significant pandemic events or turning points.

**Interactive Visualization with Shiny:**

-   To make our analysis more interactive and user-friendly, we will utilize the shiny package in R to develop a web application. This application will allow users to dynamically interact with the data through filters such as year, country name, and regions. Users can select specific parameters to refine the visualizations, providing a customized view that can highlight trends and patterns of interest within the global scope of the COVID-19 pandemic.

-   This dynamic approach will enable users to explore the data in a more granular and personalized manner, enhancing the analytical value of the visualizations.

### For the second question:

**Dataset Utilization**: We will employ the `usa_county_wise_data` dataset, which is rich in localized COVID-19 data for the United States, encompassing each county's case and vaccination figures. And `vaccination` dataset provides the details of vaccian all over the world.

**Primary Focus**: We aim to analyze and visualize how COVID-19 cases and vaccination rates have evolved over time across U.S. counties and globally, identifying patterns and correlations.

**Visualizations**

-   **Choropleth Maps**: We will craft choropleth maps to visually represent the density or intensity of COVID-19 cases and vaccination rates across U.S. counties. This will enable a straightforward interpretation of regional variances and trends.

-   **Bubble Maps**: To enhance our spatial analysis, bubble maps will be constructed where each bubble's size indicates either the number of cases or vaccination rates in counties, offering a dual perspective on the pandemic's magnitude and the vaccination effort.

-   **Time-Lapse Visualizations**: Implementing time-lapse maps will allow us to observe and analyze the progression of the pandemic and vaccination rollout over time, providing dynamic insights into how the situation has evolved across different regions.
