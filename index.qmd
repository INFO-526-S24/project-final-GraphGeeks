## Introduction 

In late December 2019, a novel coronavirus, initially designated as 2019-nCoV, emerged in the city of Wuhan, located in China's Hubei province. The outbreak garnered global attention as reports surfaced of individuals developing pneumonia-like symptoms without a clear cause. Complicating matters further, existing vaccines and treatments proved ineffective against the new virus strain.

One of the most concerning aspects of the outbreak was the evidence of human-to-human transmission, signifying the potential for rapid spread across populations. By mid-January 2020, the transmission rate, or rate of infection, began to escalate, prompting heightened international concern and response efforts.

As of 30 January 2020, approximately 8,243 cases of the novel coronavirus had been confirmed worldwide, marking a significant public health challenge requiring swift and coordinated action.

Through our analysis, which includes dynamic and interactive visualizations made possible by Shiny, we aim to provide stakeholders, including policymakers and the public, with intuitive tools to explore and understand the evolving dynamics of the pandemic. These interactive visualizations not only enhance accessibility but also facilitate deeper insights into the spread of the virus, patterns of transmission, the effectiveness of containment measures, and the progress of global vaccination campaigns sourced from Our World in Data. By merging and analyzing vaccination information alongside COVID-19 case data, our goal is to offer a comprehensive understanding of the pandemic's dynamics. Ultimately, our aim is to empower decision-makers with actionable insights derived from rigorous analysis, enabling them to make informed decisions and craft effective strategies to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on communities worldwide.

## Abstract

This project focuses on analyzing global and US-specific COVID-19 trends and vaccination impacts using dynamic visualizations powered by the Shiny app package. By merging data from reputable sources like Our World in Data, we aim to provide comprehensive insights into the pandemic's dynamics, including transmission rates, containment measures' efficacy, and vaccination progress. Our objective is to empower policymakers and the public with actionable insights to effectively respond to the ongoing health crisis.

## Dataset and Description

The dataset comprises several files providing detailed information on COVID-19 cases and vaccination efforts globally. The "full_grouped.csv" file offers day-to-day country-wise case counts, including County/State/Province level data. "covid_19_clean_complete.csv" also provides day-to-day country-wise case counts but lacks County/State/Province level data. "country_wise_latest.csv" presents the latest country-level case statistics, while "day_wise.csv" offers day-wise case counts without country-level data. "usa_county_wise.csv" contains day-to-day county-level case counts specifically for the USA. Additionally, "worldometer_data.csv" provides the latest data from the Worldometer website.

The vaccination dataset includes key information such as the country, ISO code, and date of data entry. It also encompasses metrics such as the total number of vaccinations, total number of people vaccinated, and total number of people fully vaccinated. Other metrics include daily vaccinations, total vaccinations per hundred, and daily vaccinations per million. Moreover, the dataset identifies the vaccines used in each country and provides insights into vaccination rates relative to the total population. This comprehensive dataset enables detailed analysis of global vaccination efforts and their impact on combating the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Question 1

How has the COVID-19 pandemic trended globally over time, and what correlations can be observed between different pandemic metrics (like cases and recoveries)?

### Analysis:
We analyze the global spread and recovery from COVID-19 by creating detailed time series visualizations of confirmed cases and recovery rates. This analysis helps us understand how the virus has propagated and been managed over time across different geographies.

### Time Series of Country’s COVID-19
![](images/clipboard-3950227123.png)

### Time Series of US’s COVID- 19
![](images/clipboard-1312047739.png)

### Detailed Discussion:
The time series visualization demonstrates distinct waves of COVID-19 infections globally, with corresponding recoveries. Analyzing these trends helps to identify the effectiveness of public health interventions and the burden on health systems over time. This visualization particularly highlights the periods where recoveries lagged behind new cases, indicating stress points in healthcare responses.

## Question 2

What is the relationship between total vaccinations and the reduction in active COVID-19 cases across different Counties in USA?

### Analysis:
We explore the relationship between vaccination rates and active COVID-19 cases to evaluate the effectiveness of vaccination campaigns across different regions in the USA. We employ scatter plots and regression analysis to quantify this relationship.

## Conclusion 
Our analysis through interactive Shiny visualizations provides significant insights into the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic. Question 1("How has the COVID-19 pandemic trended globally over time, and what correlations can be observed between different pandemic metrics?") revealed the global patterns of infection and recovery, underscoring the critical times and effectiveness of interventions. Question 2("What is the relationship between total vaccinations and the reduction in active COVID-19 cases across different Counties in USA?") illustrated the crucial role of vaccinations in reducing active cases, highlighting the success of vaccination campaigns in mitigating the pandemic's impact. This project not only enhances our understanding of the pandemic but also supports policymakers and public health officials in making informed decisions based on data-driven insights.
