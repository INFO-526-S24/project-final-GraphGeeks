## Introduction

-   Comprehensive analysis of COVID-19 data from Kaggle, focusing on case counts, recovery rates, mortality, and vaccination data.

-   Utilizing Shiny app package for interactive and user-friendly data visualization.

-   Providing actionable insights for policymakers and the public.

-   Clear communication of complex data to aid in understanding and response to the global health crisis.

## Dataset

-   Kaggle datasets curated by "imdevskp" offer global, country-wise, and detailed COVID-19 statistics, covering day-wise global data, country-wise snapshots, and granular USA county-level breakdowns.

-   These datasets contain critical metrics like case counts, deaths, recoveries, and vaccinations, facilitating in-depth analysis of pandemic trends and impacts.

-   Researchers can utilize these datasets to gain insights into the progression and effects of the COVID-19 pandemic globally and within specific countries and regions.
