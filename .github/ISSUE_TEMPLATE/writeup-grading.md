Dear TEAM_NAME: Below is the score breakdown for your write-up. Details of things that should be updated/revised are provided in separate issues. As you address them, you should close the individual issues.

You can do this in one of two ways:

- On GitHub, by clicking on Close issue
- Via a commit that directly addresses the issue.

Please use the second method wherever a fix can be tied to a commit. If you preface your commit messages with "Fixes", "Fixed", "Fix", "Closed", or "Close", the issue will be closed when you push the changes to your repo. For example, suppose you want to close issue `#2` which, hypothetically, suggested that you add a new line to the README, your commit message can say something like `Add a new line to the README, closes #2`.

Once you've closed all of the other issues, close this one as well, so that going into the presentation you have no open issues remaining.
